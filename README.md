# expressionevaluator
This Python program evaluates simple mathematical expressions. The program includes test
cases to show that the expressionevaluator() function returns the correct result and that an
Exception is raised when the user does not enter an operator as their first value. At this
point in time, the only operators that will be evaluated are + and -. The syntax is always
operator expression expression. The program is set up so that the user simply has to load
the program into their environment and run it. The user will be prompted to enter an expression
to be evaluated and will return the result. The user may also add multiple expressions to be
evaluated. For example, "+ 1 4 - 3" evaluates to "2".

The program is designed to continue to prompt the user for an expression until the user enters a
valid mathematical expression or hits CTRL+C to quit.
